# CartPop - Shopify App

This is a sample app to help developers bootstrap their Shopify app development.

It leverages the [Shopify API Library](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-node-api) on the backend to create [an embedded app](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/app-bridge/getting-started#embed-your-app-in-the-shopify-admin), and [Polaris](https://github.com/Shopify/polaris-react) and [App Bridge React](https://shopify.dev/tools/app-bridge/react-components) on the frontend.

This is the repository used when you create a new Node app with the [Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/apps/tools/cli).

## Requirements

- Shopify Partner account
- Node 16+

## Installation

Using the [Shopify CLI](https://github.com/Shopify/shopify-cli) run:

```sh
shopify app create node -n APP_NAME
```

Or, you can run `npx degit shopify/shopify-app-node` and create a `.env` file containing the following values:

```yaml
SHOPIFY_API_KEY={api key}           # Your API key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET={api secret key} # Your API secret key
SCOPES={scopes}                     # Your app's required scopes, comma-separated
HOST={your app's host}              # Your app's host, without the protocol prefix
```
